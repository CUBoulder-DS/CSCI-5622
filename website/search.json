Using the external API service, these limitations were able to be avoided. The search queries chosen to search for items were based on top 100 Amazon searches, found on this site and this site. An example of using the API, along with its core endpoint, is below.\n\nimport requests\n\npayload = {\n   'api_key': 'API_KEY',\n   'query': 'iphone 15 charger',\n   's': 'price-asc-rank'\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.scraperapi.com/structured/amazon/search',\n                        params=payload).json()\n\nThe jupyter notebook code for the web scraping can be found here.\nAdditionally, more data was used to supplement the existing data. Since the scraped data was only about 26K rows, a Kaggle dataset was used that contains more than one million rows, had around the same fields as the scraped data, and was also from the USA (many Amazon Kaggle datasets were from the non-US).\nThe raw data from both sources can be seen below in Table 1:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The raw data from both datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The raw data scraped from Amazon using ScraperAPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nposition\nasin\nname\nimage\nhas_prime\nis_best_seller\nis_amazon_choice\nis_limited_deal\nstars\ntotal_reviews\nurl\navailability_quantity\nspec\nprice_string\nprice_symbol\nprice\noriginal_price\nsection_name\n\n\n\n\n0\nsearch_product\n15\nB06XG67PDD\nAmScope3.5X-180X Trinocular Stereo Zoom Micros...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cMzreAer...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nNaN\nNaN\nhttps://www.amazon.com/AmScope-3-5X-180X-Trino...\nNaN\n{}\n$1,355.99\n$\n1355.99\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1\nsearch_product\n26\nB08R6BV4GV\nModa West96/180 Pack Wholesale Bulk Case of Me...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qU5avfuM...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n4.6\n162.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/180-Pairs-Ankle-Athleti...\nNaN\n{}\n$188.99\n$\n188.99\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n2\nsearch_product\n20\nB0B2RMCCJS\nEurzom10 Pairs Smiling Face Socks Elastic Ankl...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yDS7H0VF...\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n4.6\n298.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Smiling-Elastic-Aesthet...\nNaN\n{}\n$16.99\n$\n16.99\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n3\nsearch_product\n18\nB0741DT22M\nCharmin Ultra Strong Toilet Paper, 18 Super Me...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nbq5MZB-...\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n4.8\n4766.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Charmin-Super-Strong-To...\nNaN\n{}\n$29.77\n$\n29.77\n{'price_string': '$32.99', 'price_symbol': '$'...\nNaN\n\n\n4\nsearch_product\n18\nB08T6NF8GR\nPokémon Electronic & Interactive My Partner Ch...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71mlLo2fSN...\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n4.6\n13410.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Interactive-...\nNaN\n{}\n$22.99\n$\n22.99\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The raw data gotten from Kaggle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nasin\ntitle\nimgUrl\nproductURL\nstars\nreviews\nprice\nlistPrice\ncategory_id\nisBestSeller\nboughtInLastMonth\n\n\n\n\n0\nB09T6K1GX2\nLarge Stuffed Animal Net or Hammock with LED L...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711rC9E5yu...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B09T6K1GX2\n4.4\n0\n20.99\n0.00\n41\nFalse\n200\n\n\n1\nB08Q73DYYN\nGirls' Bermuda Jean Shorts, Stretch Denim, Mid...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91SyiIT1yR...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Q73DYYN\n4.1\n0\n21.91\n27.99\n91\nFalse\n0\n\n\n2\nB09X9G9ZLJ\nQuest 2 Elite Strap with Battery 6000mAh Vrbor...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XjaChbqa...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X9G9ZLJ\n4.4\n0\n39.99\n45.99\n263\nFalse\n0\n\n\n3\nB07C75PKMV\nPearl Earrings Freshwater Pearl White Button S...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51m8nl3Gxq...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C75PKMV\n4.5\n0\n19.99\n0.00\n123\nFalse\n50\n\n\n4\nB08BNH4KX3\nWomens Party Dress Sequins Tulle Sexy V-Neck L...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gE2aMZZS...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BNH4KX3\n4.0\n0\n78.99\n129.99\n116\nFalse\n50",

    "text": "In today’s digital landscape dominated by e-commerce giants such as Amazon, the analysis of retail product data assumes paramount importance as a means to unravel the intricacies of consumer behavior, and unveil the complex relationships that exist between various products. The topic of this project poses a fundamental assertion: that mining the vast repository of Amazon’s retail product data holds the key to unlocking invaluable insights that can revolutionize marketing strategies, inform product development, and optimize overall business operations. This assertion underscores the critical role of data analytics in shaping the success trajectory of businesses operating in the contemporary marketplace. By delving into the granular details of consumer interactions with products on Amazon’s platform, stakeholders gain not only a deeper understanding of consumer preferences but also a nuanced perspective on the dynamics of the digital marketplace itself. The implications of this analysis extend far beyond mere academic curiosity; they are deeply intertwined with the strategic imperatives of businesses seeking to thrive amidst fierce competition and rapid technological advancements. The significance of analyzing Amazon retail product data transcends individual businesses, permeating into the realms of consumer behavior, marketing efficacy, policymaking, and academic research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of navigating Amazon\n\n\n\n\nAt its core, this endeavor resonates with a diverse array of stakeholders, each with a vested interest in deciphering the underlying patterns shaping modern consumption patterns and economic dynamics. Consumers, for instance, stand to benefit from the insights gleaned through data analysis, which can translate into more personalized shopping experiences, enhanced product recommendations, and greater transparency within the marketplace. Much work has been done, for example, to improve search engine results and product classification for recommendation purposes (Medini et al. 2019; Smith and Linden 2017). Marketers, on the other hand, find in this data a treasure trove of actionable intelligence, enabling them to fine-tune advertising strategies, optimize pricing models, and anticipate shifts in consumer preferences with a heightened degree of accuracy (Chen, Mislove, and Wilson 2016; Chevalier and Goolsbee 2003). Furthermore, researchers across various disciplines are drawn to the rich dataset offered by Amazon, utilizing sophisticated analytical techniques ranging from machine learning algorithms to traditional statistical methods to unravel the complexities of consumer behavior and product relationships (Shaikh, Rathi, and Janrao 2017; Bell and Bala 2015). Despite the considerable strides made in this field, there remains an abundance of untapped potential, beckoning further exploration and innovation to fully harness the transformative power of Amazon’s retail product data.\n\n\n\nIs there noticable trends in prices over time, over all products?\nAre there price trends over time within a specific product category?\nIs there any meaningful similarities in the images between products with similar descriptions?\nAre there price/rating similarities between the products with similar images?\nDo ratings have any correlation with the price of products?\nDo ratings have any correlation with the product category?\nCan the price of a product be predicted based on all other factors?\nCan the rating of a product be predicted based on all other factors?\nCan the category of a product be predicted based on the description?\nIs the description of a product similar to the generated description based on the product image (or the generated bag of words, tags, etc)?",

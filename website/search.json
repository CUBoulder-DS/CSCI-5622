Using the external API service, these limitations were able to be avoided. The search queries chosen to search for items were based on top 100 Amazon searches, found on this site and this site. An example of using the API, along with its core endpoint, is below.\n\nimport requests\n\npayload = {\n   'api_key': 'API_KEY',\n   'query': 'iphone 15 charger',\n   's': 'price-asc-rank'\n}\n\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.scraperapi.com/structured/amazon/search',\n                        params=payload).json()\n\nThe jupyter notebook code for the web scraping can be found here.\nAdditionally, more data was used to supplement the existing data. Since the scraped data was only about 26K rows, a Kaggle dataset was used that contains more than one million rows, had around the same fields as the scraped data, and was also from the USA (many Amazon Kaggle datasets were from the non-US).\nThe raw data from both sources can be seen below in Table 1; the scraped raw data CSV can also be viewed here.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The raw data from both datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) The raw data scraped from Amazon using ScraperAPI\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nposition\nasin\nname\nimage\nhas_prime\nis_best_seller\nis_amazon_choice\nis_limited_deal\nstars\ntotal_reviews\nurl\navailability_quantity\nspec\nprice_string\nprice_symbol\nprice\noriginal_price\nsection_name\n\n\n\n\n0\nsearch_product\n13\nB0CSDZM9GP\nLG 65QNED80UQA 65 Inch QNED Mini-LED Smart TV ...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bdweQQPw...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nNaN\nNaN\nhttps://www.amazon.com/LG-65QNED80UQA-Mini-LED...\n6.0\n{}\n$796.99\n$\n796.99\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n1\nsearch_product\n32\nB0CJ4XNWDB\nTanamoWater Shoes for Women Men Quick Dry Swim...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Z8puwpYT...\nTrue\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n4.6\n165.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Tanamo-Barefoot-Boating...\nNaN\n{}\n$28.99\n$\n28.99\n{'price_string': '$35.99', 'price_symbol': '$'...\nNaN\n\n\n2\nsearch_product\n3\nB0CVCN3WF6\nfor L Shaped Desk Corner Computer Gaming Lapto...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61waqBCgiQ...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nNaN\nNaN\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVCN3WF6/ref=sr_1_...\nNaN\n{}\n$140.04\n$\n140.04\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n3\nsearch_product\n14\nB07X88D1Q7\nAvengers Endgame 4K Ultra HD Limited Edition S...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81M76FHY0A...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n3.7\n4.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Avengers-Endgame-Limite...\nNaN\n{}\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n4\nsearch_product\n10\nB07YFGGPH3\nSanDisk 64GB Ultra SDXC UHS-I Memory Card - 10...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zwj6gDtC...\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\nFalse\n4.7\n88505.0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-UHS-I-Mem...\nNaN\n{}\n$9.17\n$\n9.17\n{'price_string': '$12.99', 'price_symbol': '$'...\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The raw data gotten from Kaggle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nasin\ntitle\nimgUrl\nproductURL\nstars\nreviews\nprice\nlistPrice\ncategory_id\nisBestSeller\nboughtInLastMonth\n\n\n\n\n0\nB0BLH2HKBD\nMagnetic Car Set, Compatible with Magnetic Til...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713T++8R68...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLH2HKBD\n4.7\n0\n9.99\n0.0\n225\nFalse\n100\n\n\n1\nB00C6BY6R4\nGraco Fusion Gun Grease Lube 3 oz 117773\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21NsgCcYTY...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B00C6BY6R4\n5.0\n5\n18.99\n0.0\n141\nFalse\n0\n\n\n2\nB08XG1KNT8\nDinosaur Zip-Up Waterproof Hooded Rain Jacket ...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91JDliBXsI...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XG1KNT8\n4.9\n31\n34.98\n0.0\n84\nFalse\n0\n\n\n3\nB0B9T6LTB2\nBoys Active Shirt - Quick-Dry Athletic Workout...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91RojxJW6F...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9T6LTB2\n4.7\n0\n29.99\n0.0\n84\nFalse\n0\n\n\n4\nB09JT3JNC7\nCD 4714 Spiderman Spider Logo 2 Pack Viny Deca...\nhttps://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61G5uyyI0C...\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JT3JNC7\n4.3\n211\n5.23\n0.0\n24\nFalse\n100",

    "text": "Data Preprocessing / Visualization\nVarious types of EDA were performed in order to examine the data; as a note, most visuals are interactive (zoomable, pannable, etc). The code for all visualizations can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf the interactive figures don’t load (is blank screen space with caption showing), dont worry: just turn off all ad-blockers/privacy browsing, make sure that Chrome/Firefox is being used, and refresh the page (or close and re-open the website) until all figures load.\n\n\nFirst, a histogram of all categories of all Amazon products is shown in Figure 1. Note scraped data did not have categories, but the Kaggle data did. It can be seen that from the figure, girl’s and boy’s clothing are the most populous categories, with toys & games the next most populous.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 1: A histogram of all categories of all Amazon products. Note scraped data did not have categories, but the Kaggle data did.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows a histogram of the stars recieved for a product. It can be seen that the number of stars increases generally exponentially until 4.6 stars, with peaks at 0 and 5 stars as well. This data generally agrees with what can be seen on Amazon when browsing personally, and the peaks at 0 and 5 agree with having low number of reviews.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 2: Histogram of the number of stars recieved for all products.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows violin plots of the numerical factors: volume of product bought in the month, the price of a product, and the number of reviews. A violin plot was chosen because a histogram would be visually uninformative, due to the amount of outliers. Some insights that can be drawn from these violin plots are:\n\nThese factors have a good number of outliers that are extremely large in value compared to the general distribution of values. This does not seem to be from incorrect values, but from sellers attempting to “game the system”.\n“Bought in Month” has outliers that are regularly spaced, indicating either a form of gaming the system by sellers that tend to follow specific formats, or Amazon only reports volume of bought products at low granularity for high-volume products.\nPrice tends to have outliers that continue regularly up the price scale, except for a couple at the $60-70k range. It is unclear whether to drop those rows containing those prices as they seem valid; it is entirely possible that sellers just list the product at a completely unreasonable price as a placeholder, and don’t expect anyone to purchase at that price.\nThe number of reviews for a product have been shown to be easily gameable with fake reviews, and is likely what is happening here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plot of the number of a product bought in a month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plot of price of a product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin plot of the number of reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Violin plots (with overlayed box plot and outliers) of 3 of the main numerical columns.\n\n\n\nThe amount of stars, vs the number of reviews for a product can be seen in Figure 4, colored with the Is Best Seller flag. It can be seen that the distribution of Is Best Seller items tends to follow the overall distribution; additionally, the number of reviews tends to increase as the number of stars increases, with the products with the outlier number of reviews (over 200k) all above 4 stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Stars vs number of reviews recieved by an amazon product, colored by whether the product was a best-seller.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to visualize the content of the text factors, namely the Category and Name of a product, a wordcloud format was used; wordclouds visualize the words that tend to appear in the text with the more frequent words appearing in larger text. In Figure 5, it can be seen that in the categories, “Care”, “Products”, “Boy’s Clothing”, “Consoles”, “Accessories”, and “Games” appear most. In the names of procucts, the words “Stainles Steel”, “Compatible”, “Heavy Duty”, “Boy”, “Girl”, and “Birthday” appear the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordcloud for categories of products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWordcloud for the names of products\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Wordclouds (where more frequent appearing words are bigger) of the categories of products and the names of products.\n\n\n\nThe number of stars vs price, with price being on a log scale (to hangle outliers) is shown in Figure 6, along with being colored by if it’s a best seller. As was seen in Figure 4, the distribution of Is Best Seller items tends to follow the overall distribution; additionally, it can be seen that there are products with a price up to $10k across all number of stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: The number of stars a product recieved, vs the price in log scale, colored by whether the product was a best seller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation of products in both sets of data\nThe following plots focused on products that had the same Asin (identifying ID), that were in both the data personally scraped in 2024 and the Kaggle data from 2023. Investigating this subset of data could reveal a lot about how product prices, reviews, and other factors changed over time, as the only way to get time difference data was to use products that actually had more than one timepoint.\nFigure 7 shows the price vs list price of items, colored by what date they were scraped on, with a trendline plotted. It can be seen that on the whole, list price and actual price match and that prices seem to have increased since 2023 to 2024; however, below $50 price (when zooming in) the trendlines cross, implying that lower-priced products actually decreased in price.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 7: Price vs list price of items with the same ASIN across dates scraped, with a trendline.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that outliers can be seen in price affecting the plot of the graph, it was decided for analysis to only consider those prices most populous, aka prices less than $800. Given that, the prices of each Asin were plotted, along with being colored by if the price increased from 2023 to 2024, or decreased. It can be seen that in Figure 8 that indeed for lower priced products (less than $50) the prices mostly did not increase, and instead decreased or stayed the same. The histogram shows the frequency of higher-priced procucts generally exponentially decreasing, and the likelihood of the price increasing going up.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 8: Histogram of prices, colored by whether the change in price increased or decreased over time, for those items that were in both sets of data.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9 shows a more granular form of the previous plot by plotting price vs the actual price difference amount from 2023 to 2024, with the ability to investigate which products are having such a dramatic increase or decrease in price over time. It can be seen that tech and suitcases were the outliers in price increase, and tech also being the outliers in price decrease.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 9: Price vs the difference in price, over the two sets of data, colored by whether the price diff increased or decreased.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it was investigated as to which product categories exactly had a price increase or decrease, and the ratio of number of increases to decreases. Only categories with more than 20 products were included, to reduce noise and to focus on meaningful categories. In Figure 10, it can be seen that “Sports and Outdoors”, “Makeup”, “Electrical Equipment”, and “Building Toys” all had more price increases than decreases; every other product category had more price decreases than increases, with “Smart Homes” and “Gift Cards” having the most price decreases.\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nFigure 10: For the included categories, a bar chat showing the ratio of products that had their price increase over time vs decrease.",

    "text": "In today’s digital landscape dominated by e-commerce giants such as Amazon, the analysis of retail product data assumes paramount importance as a means to unravel the intricacies of consumer behavior, and unveil the complex relationships that exist between various products. The topic of this project poses a fundamental assertion: that mining the vast repository of Amazon’s retail product data holds the key to unlocking invaluable insights that can revolutionize marketing strategies, inform product development, and optimize overall business operations. This assertion underscores the critical role of data analytics in shaping the success trajectory of businesses operating in the contemporary marketplace. By delving into the granular details of consumer interactions with products on Amazon’s platform, stakeholders gain not only a deeper understanding of consumer preferences but also a nuanced perspective on the dynamics of the digital marketplace itself. The implications of this analysis extend far beyond mere academic curiosity; they are deeply intertwined with the strategic imperatives of businesses seeking to thrive amidst fierce competition and rapid technological advancements. The significance of analyzing Amazon retail product data transcends individual businesses, permeating into the realms of consumer behavior, marketing efficacy, policymaking, and academic research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of navigating Amazon\n\n\n\n\nAt its core, this endeavor resonates with a diverse array of stakeholders, each with a vested interest in deciphering the underlying patterns shaping modern consumption patterns and economic dynamics. Consumers, for instance, stand to benefit from the insights gleaned through data analysis, which can translate into more personalized shopping experiences, enhanced product recommendations, and greater transparency within the marketplace. Much work has been done, for example, to improve search engine results and product classification for recommendation purposes (Medini et al. 2019; Smith and Linden 2017). Marketers, on the other hand, find in this data a treasure trove of actionable intelligence, enabling them to fine-tune advertising strategies, optimize pricing models, and anticipate shifts in consumer preferences with a heightened degree of accuracy (Chen, Mislove, and Wilson 2016; Chevalier and Goolsbee 2003). Furthermore, researchers across various disciplines are drawn to the rich dataset offered by Amazon, utilizing sophisticated analytical techniques ranging from machine learning algorithms to traditional statistical methods to unravel the complexities of consumer behavior and product relationships (Shaikh, Rathi, and Janrao 2017; Bell and Bala 2015). Despite the considerable strides made in this field, there remains an abundance of untapped potential, beckoning further exploration and innovation to fully harness the transformative power of Amazon’s retail product data.\n\n\n\nIs there noticable trends in prices over time, over all products?\nAre there price trends over time within a specific product category?\nIs there any meaningful similarities in the images between products with similar descriptions?\nAre there price/rating similarities between the products with similar images?\nDo ratings have any correlation with the price of products?\nDo ratings have any correlation with the product category?\nCan the price of a product be predicted based on all other factors?\nCan the rating of a product be predicted based on all other factors?\nCan the category of a product be predicted based on the description?\nIs the description of a product similar to the generated description based on the product image (or the generated bag of words, tags, etc)?",
